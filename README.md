# Abstract
The home automation or domotics has the meaning of automating and controlling electronic systems present at a user’s home. This means that we can easily control every electronic equipment in a house through the internet, making a person’s life more comfortable and efficient. 
Domotics is a network of hardware, communication, and electronic interfaces that are integrated with our daily routine devices through the internet for user access. Each equipment has an embedded sensor and is connected through the WiFi making it possible managing through a web platform at home or another different location. This allows us to turn off lights, locking the entrance or even initiate the process of cooling a home division. 
There are three main elements in a domotics system: sensors, controllers and actuators. 
• Sensors can monitor daylight, temperature, movement, presence of gases, rain intensity, pressure. These systems can be adjusted to the preference of their user. • Controllers refer to an equipment – personal computers, tablets or even smartphones, that are used to send or receive messages about the state of functions present on the home automation system. • Actuators can be light switches, engines, or motorized valves that control the mechanisms or functions of a home automation system. They can be programmed to be activated through remote control of a controller. 
The residential automation systems offer a vast variety of services and functions. The main functions available through these platforms are: 
• Fire and carbon monoxide detection • Remote control of lights • Temperature and humidity monitorization • IP camera and access control system • Real time alerts in text and emails • Voice control 
The advantages of using these home automation systems are present in four topics (security, comfort, energy saving and communication).
